# Bedroom-Lighting-Future
Welcome to my IoT project! It focuses on bedroom lighting of the future, looking at circadian rhythms and emotional lighting.

Lighting is a major aspect of the bedroom which directly affects our mental and physical wellbeing. Artificial lighting has negatively impacted our sleep cycles. I wanted to determine how misaligned my sleep pattern was to the natural cycle of the sun, and then make automated interventions through bedroom IoT devices that encourage my cycle to shift. Being able to visualise the misalignment of my cycle was more meaningful than just seeing the hours that I slept. It contextualised the data and showed me just how poor my schedule was (it's better now though). The second part I wanted to try was visualising my emotions in an intuitive way through RGB lighting and identify them using a camera with an emotion classifier. A potential route for this would be to aid non-verbal communication between individuals who struggle to communicate, although a much better model would need to be trained for this.

Feel free to leave any comments or suggestions - happy to help if anyone wants to build their own sleep analysis/lighting project.
